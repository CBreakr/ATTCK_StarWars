## Page Summary

This toy application is meant to serve as a demonstration of React and CSS using a fun and familiar subject - Star Wars.

The page will load a set of pre-selected characters to a main selection page and allow the user to click on their card displays to see a list of the films that character has been featured in.

While looking for character images of roughly uniform size and quality to use, I stumbled across some old trading cards. I decided that I wanted to go for a somewhat retro feel to the page while leaning on the colors and styles of the films (including the original star background). I thought that this worked well with the fact that the data and interaction of the page was limited.

### Styling

The page is responsive, with differing displays for mobile, web, and varying larger widths. Mobile displays have a single column, while wider displays have multiple columns and a "carousel" for the film listing.

I had originally kept my styling within the react components, but the degree of interconnection between the styles and the layers of media queries made it feel easier to manage as separate central css files.

## Default CRA Information

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
